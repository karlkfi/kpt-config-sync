# NOTE: When updating this file, you will also need to do the following:
#
# 1. Increment the BUILDENV_IMAGE variable in Makefile
# 2. Run the following locally to test the build then push the image so it's
#    accessible by CI:
#    $ make build-buildenv && make build && make push-buildenv
# 3. Upload your change for review and check the CI results.  Note that Prow
#    will fail if you have not uploaded your new image.
