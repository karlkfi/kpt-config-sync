description: "This repo is the home for Kubernetes OpenAPI discovery spec generation. The goal  is to support a subset of OpenAPI features to satisfy kubernetes use-cases but  implement that subset with little to no assumption about the structure of the  code or routes. Thus, there should be no kubernetes specific code in this repo."
