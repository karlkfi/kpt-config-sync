name: "mapstructure"
description: "This library is most useful when decoding values from some data stream (JSON, Gob, etc.) where you don't _quite_ know the structure of the underlying data until you read a part of it. You can therefore read a `map[string]interface{}` and use this library to decode it into the proper underlying native Go structure."
