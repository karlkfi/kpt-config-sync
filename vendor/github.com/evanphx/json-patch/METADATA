description: "There is a single global configuration variable `jsonpatch.SupportNegativeIndices'. This defaults to `true` and enables the non-standard practice of allowing negative indices to mean indices starting at the end of an array. This functionality can be disabled by setting `jsonpatch.SupportNegativeIndices = false`."
