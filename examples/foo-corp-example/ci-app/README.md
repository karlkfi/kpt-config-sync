# Validating your app against company policies in a continuous integration pipeline

This repository contains the code used in the [Validating your app against company policies in a continuous integration pipeline](https://cloud.google.com/tbd)
tutorial.

If your organization uses Anthos Config Management and Policy Controller to manage
policies across its Anthos clusters, then you can validate an appâ€™s deployment
configuration in its continuous integration (CI) pipeline. This tutorial demonstrates
how to achieve this result. It will be useful to you if you are a developer building
a CI pipeline for an app, or a platform engineer building a CI pipeline template
for multiple app teams.
