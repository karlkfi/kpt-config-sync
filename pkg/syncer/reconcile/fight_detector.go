// Required reading to understand the math:

//
// Specifically, fightDetector uses the below linear differential equation to
// estimate the number of updates a resource has per minute.
//
// y' = -y + k(t)
//
// Where `y` is the estimated rate, `k` is the actual (potentially variable)
// rate of updates, and t is time. If k(t) is a constant, y(t) converges to `k`
// exponentially. When y and k(t) are approximately equal, y' remains about zero.

// The implementation below uses an approximation to the above as updates are
// quantized (there is no such thing as 0.5 of an update).
