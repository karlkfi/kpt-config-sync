# KNV1002: DuplicateDirectoryNameError

The name of every directory in a repository MUST be distinct within the entire repo.

To fix, rename one of the conflicting directories.
If the renamed directory contains a Namespace, you also need to update `metadata.name` to reflect the new directory name.

# Examples

This can happen if two directories with different paths share the same name.
For instance, a directory structure that includes both foo/bar and baz/bar generates this error.

```
/namespaces/
├── foo/
│   └── bar/
└── qux/
    └── bar/
```

The above would produce this error:

```
KNV1002: Directory names MUST be unique. Rename one of these directories:

foo/bar
qux/bar
```

Another way to cause is error is a directory structure such as foo/foo/ or foo/bar/foo/.

```
/namespaces/
└── bar/
    └── foo/
        └── bar/
```

The above would produce this error:

```
KNV1002: Directory names MUST be unique. Rename one of these directories:

bar
bar/foo/bar
```
